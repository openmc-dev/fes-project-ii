# An Open Source Nuclear Modeling Ecosystem to Support Fusion Pilot Plant Design

Repository for collaborative project between MIT and ANL supported by
U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science (Fusion Energy Sciences). The
overarching goals of this project are to:

1. Implement new features to support synthetic diagnostic development.
2. Fundamentally improve radiation damage calculations
3. Expand capabilities for mesh-based representations for high-fidelity
   engineering analysis and multiphysics simulation.
4. Develop data-driven rationale for the use of OpenMC in fusion licensing
   applications
